# n00bsatcode - GarudaHacks Solution
 taking the education solutions path, this team notices that :
 
 **PROBLEMS TO ADDRESS :**
 - Difficulty in managing tons of tabs to do school projects and research;
 - Especially receiving and keeping track of deadlines,
 - Schedules too
 
 **SOLUTION** :
 - A website utilizing Google Classroom API to input data from a user's Classes to their startup page, where 
 - our Timer Feature would remind them of deadlines (period of which will be determined through Settings)
 - our To-Do List will give them their deadlines and place it in their Google Calendar*
 
 **COMPONENTS** :
 - Structured, well-designed front end website, has to have reactive buttons for To-Do List and Timer descriptions. ( HTML/ CSS code)
 - Backend - link To-Do List headers to external websites (React.js)
 
 **TECHNOLOGIES USED** :
 - React — to render the HTML dynamically, based on the websites that the user wants to add
 - localStorage — to save the data based on browser
 - Google Classroom API
